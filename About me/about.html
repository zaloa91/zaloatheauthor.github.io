                <h2>Hello, I'm Zaloa!</h2>
                <p>                   
                    I've always had a deep passion for storytelling. As a child, I used to craft various fantasy tales, often inspired by my own experiences. It wasn't until 2014 that my journey took a significant turn when I discovered Episode. This platform completely transformed my approach to writing.
                    
                    For years, I grappled with writing and coding, trying to bring my stories to life. After much perseverance, I finally managed to create something meaningful just last year.
                    
                    Though I'm not a seasoned professional or a renowned author, the dedication and love I pour into my stories are immense. My journey has been marked by challenges, especially with managing Episode as a writer. That's why I decided to create this websiteâ€”to offer support and guidance to those who find themselves in a similar situation.
                    
                    To everyone navigating their creative paths, remember that your passion matters. Thank you for being a part of this journey. I cherish each and every one of you, my beautiful souls.
